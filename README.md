# TUKme
Problem:
The people in Gauteng live life in the fast lane, with their feet. 
Many of them do not have cars but need to travel to work, school, 
meetings quickly and do not have the time to wait for a taxi to pick them up, or to load. 
People need an easy comfortable, and cheap way to travel. 
The Uber service in Gauteng is very expensive, which a lot of people and students cannot afford.
The TukTuk charges, a flat rate of R25 for up to 3km and R35 for up to 5km. 
The TukTuk is a well-known in johannesburg. It provides an excellent transport service by picking the 
passenger from their current position and drops them off exactly at their destination (home, work). 

Solution:
create a mobile Application which can be used by the TukTuk drivers to help
them find passengers easily and quickly. The app can be used by the customers 
to find comfortable transportation, which is also cheap, safe and reliable. 
This app will be used to add value to the business and increase the drivers reputation, 
which will decide whether they are worthy to work to the company.
People with cars can also use it, to save fuel or millage on their cars. 
Why waste fuel sitting in traffic and millage just to travel 5km when you can call a TUKTUK and pay R25
Used by those who walk, they will be safe from crime.
